Explored methylation analysis pipelines and completed a 351-article literature review for a project seeking to identify reliable epigenetic markers of schizophrenia in patients' blood samples. The work sought to describe a method, using correlated regions of methylation between the blood and brain, for accurate and inexpensive diagnosis of SCZ against other psychiatric diseases & controls. 

Completed work as part of the Laboratory of Behavioral and Psychiatric Genetics at SUNY Upstate (Dr. Chunyu Liu).
